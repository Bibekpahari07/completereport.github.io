The project for the 1st semester of Web-development consists of making a personal website which consists of 5 pages including index page, about page, cv page, contact and model_gp. The main objective is to help us to develop an attractive and responsive website with our knowledge and creativity. In this project we can use html and CSS properties to make it attractive and responsive. In this project we can also use java properties but there is no any marking for such properties. We should include brief information about ourselves including education, address, experiences and so on. Every page should contain header and footer.<br>
<br>
During the development of my website I had taken references of some websites templates. I had used some similar design of the templates because the content display of the website was good as well as they had a modern way of presenting the content to the webpage. I had taken reference from two website which is for cv page and about page. In the phase of development, I was confused to choose the correct design for the content view of website so at the beginning I tried different design but those were not as suitable for my content. So, discussed it with my collogue about this matter they suggest me to add some icons to explain it better and use some the abstract and plane color that can help you to make your website more attractive. So, I follow their advice and could produce a final output in this assignment. I also decided to put the similar design of the templates I had referenced due to their uniqueness and proper management of the content. I was unable to complete my task in the beginning of the phase but my collogue as well as the module leader helped me to develop it by their views and knowledge. My module also helped me by suggesting some of the technique and some key element that can be added to the website to make it better enough to deliver the proper content and design.<br>

During the development of the website I had drawn wireframe for the each website that helped me to make the similar design that I want to develop for this project. Wireframe of my websites are as follows:<br>

Web-development to me was an area where we can use our creativity and knowledge to make that area more attractive and beautiful. In this 1st term we learned about the html and CSS properties where CSS was new to us. We were briefly taught about html code and design in our school studies and college studies but the properties of CSS were really a new knowledge to us. CSS include the properties of the html which makes the developer easier to make their website attractive and look good. In CSS the code used is also simple which is like the formal language which makes the learner more each to learn and can add extra features to it. In 1st term we learned about the CSS properties, animation, form styles, google fonts, responsive design, flex and float properties, padding, margin, border and so on. All this element we studied in 1st term was helpful to us to make our website attractive. We could make websites which we thought to make by the help of this properties as well as with some extra study which we did among our friend’s circle and other online studying websites and YouTube channel.1st term knowledge in web-development module help us to develop our skills to make a simple website with various properties that help us to upgrade the level of the website designing and content display in various method. As this term was full of new knowledge and skills which we implement in our websites to complete our project as well as add a new skill to our-selves. I am looking forward to gaining more knowledge about the new properties that help me to upgrade my developing skills and compete to the growing competition of the real-world.<br>

During this project we were guided to check our codes weather it is valid or not. So, I valid it with the help of the W3 school validator and the screenshot of the each website which is valided by the validator is given as follow:<br>
